# Choosing response families

!!! note "Status — Stable (six families)"
    Mirrors drmTMB's [Choosing response families](https://itchyshin.github.io/drmTMB/articles/distribution-families.html).
    **In DRM.jl today:** Gaussian, Student-t, Poisson, negative-binomial (NB2),
    beta, and Gamma. More families and the `zi`/`hu` modifiers are Phase-2 work.

Pick the family from the *shape* of your response, then give each of its
parameters a formula with `bf`.

| Response looks like… | Family | Mean link | Second parameter (`sigma` slot) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Real-valued, symmetric | `Gaussian()` | identity | residual SD `σ` (log) |
| Real-valued, heavy tails / outliers | `Student()` | identity | scale `σ` (log) + d.o.f. `nu` |
| Strictly positive, continuous | `Gamma()` | log | shape `α = 1/σ²` |
| Counts (variance ≈ mean) | `Poisson()` | log | — |
| Counts, overdispersed | `NegBinomial2()` | log | dispersion `θ` (log) |
| Proportions in (0,1) | `Beta()` | logit | precision `φ = 1/σ²` |

Each family's `sigma` slot is its natural dispersion handle — the same
`sigma ~ …` formula machinery, with a family-specific link/mapping.

## Example: a Gamma model for positive data

`Gamma()` suits durations, sizes, and concentrations — strictly positive and
right-skewed. The mean uses a log link; the `sigma` slot is the **coefficient of
variation**, mapped to the shape `α = 1/σ²`:

```@example fam
using DRM, Random
import Distributions          # `Gamma` below is DRM's family; qualify the distribution
Random.seed!(20260618)

n = 3000
x = randn(n)
α = 8.0                                          # shape (CV = 1/√α ≈ 0.35)
μ = exp.(0.5 .+ 0.4 .* x)                         # log-linear mean
y = Float64.([rand(Distributions.Gamma(α, μi / α)) for μi in μ])
dat = (; y, x)

fit = drm(bf(@formula(y ~ x), @formula(sigma ~ 1)), Gamma(); data = dat)
exp(coef(fit, :mu)[2])           # multiplicative effect of x on the mean
```

```@example fam
exp(-2 * coef(fit, :sigma)[1])   # recovered shape α = 1/σ² (≈ 8)
```
