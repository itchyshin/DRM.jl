# `sigma(fit)` must be the scale the likelihood SCORED, not a raw `exp(Xσ θ̂)` the
# model never evaluated (Dinnage audit M2; vault decision D-268; #324 follow-up).
#
# Every NB2 / Gamma / Beta fitter guards the log-scale linear predictor before
# exponentiating it — `_softclamp` on the fixed-effects routes (NB2 ±20, Gamma and
# Beta ±15, margin 3), a hard `clamp` on the ranef / zi / hurdle / truncated
# routes. Post-fit the same routes stored `exp.(Xσ * θ̂)`, i.e. the UNguarded
# predictor, so on any row where the guard bit, `sigma(fit)` (and `simulate`,
# `residuals`, `predict`, all of which read `fit.scales[:sigma]`) described a
# scale the likelihood never used, and `loglik(fit)` could not be reproduced from
# the reported parameters. DRM.jl's multi-RE Gaussian route already reported the
# guarded value (`src/gaussian_ranef.jl`); this is that design applied to the rest.
# R twin: drmTMB's `drm_clamped_sigma_eta()` (commit 0526baa2f).
#
# NOTE ON THE BANDS. These are DRM.jl's own bands (NB2 ±20, Gamma/Beta ±15), NOT
# drmTMB's ±12 — a deliberate, documented difference (see `_softclamp` in
# src/negbinomial.jl and docs/design/03-likelihoods.md). This file asserts INTERNAL
# consistency (reported scale == scored scale), not band equality with R.
