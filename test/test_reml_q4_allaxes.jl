# test_reml_q4_allaxes.jl — REML for the bivariate q=4 PLSM must correct ALL FOUR
# among-axis SDs, not just the two means.
#
# Regression for the scale-axis REML gap (issue #18). The q4 REML profiles out the
# location AND scale fixed effects (β_μ1, β_μ2, β_s1, β_s2) via a bordered augmented
# state; an earlier build profiled only the means, so the restricted correction
# reached 2 of the 4 axes and the scale among-SDs moved the WRONG way under REML
# (σ1 among-SD went DOWN vs ML). The defining REML property is that the restricted
# estimate is less downward-biased: diag(Σ_a)_REML ≥ diag(Σ_a)_ML on EVERY axis.
#
# This drives the public path (drm(method=:ML/:REML)) on synthetic data with a real
# among-scale signal, and asserts the property on all four axes.
